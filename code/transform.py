    Parameters

        Whether the returned line graph is backtracking.
    shared : bool, optional

def reverse(g, share_ndata=False, share_edata=False):
    """Return the reverse of a graph

    The reverse (also called converse, transpose) of a directed graph is another directed
    graph on the same nodes with edges reversed in terms of direction.

    Given a :class:`DGLGraph` object, we return another :class:`DGLGraph` object
    representing its reverse.

    Notes
    -----
    * This function does not support :class:`~dgl.BatchedDGLGraph` objects.
    * We do not dynamically update the topology of a graph once that of its reverse changes.
      This can be particularly problematic when the node/edge attrs are shared. For example,
      if the topology of both the original graph and its reverse get changed independently,
      you can get a mismatched node/edge feature.

    Parameters
    ----------
    g : dgl.DGLGraph
    share_ndata: bool, optional
        If True, the original graph and the reversed graph share memory for node attributes.
        Otherwise the reversed graph will not be initialized with node attributes.
    share_edata: bool, optional
        If True, the original graph and the reversed graph share memory for edge attributes.
        Otherwise the reversed graph will not have edge attributes.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a graph to reverse.

    >>> import dgl
    >>> import torch as th
    >>> g = dgl.DGLGraph()
    >>> g.add_nodes(3)
    >>> g.add_edges([0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0])
    >>> g.ndata['h'] = th.tensor([[0.], [1.], [2.]])
    >>> g.edata['h'] = th.tensor([[3.], [4.], [5.]])

    Reverse the graph and examine its structure.

    >>> rg = g.reverse(share_ndata=True, share_edata=True)
    >>> print(rg)
    DGLGraph with 3 nodes and 3 edges.
    Node data: {'h': Scheme(shape=(1,), dtype=torch.float32)}
    Edge data: {'h': Scheme(shape=(1,), dtype=torch.float32)}

    The edges are reversed now.

    >>> rg.has_edges_between([1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 2])
    tensor([1, 1, 1])

    Reversed edges have the same feature as the original ones.

    >>> g.edges[[0, 2], [1, 0]].data['h'] == rg.edges[[1, 0], [0, 2]].data['h']
    tensor([[1],
            [1]], dtype=torch.uint8)

    The node/edge features of the reversed graph share memory with the original
    graph, which is helpful for both forward computation and back propagation.

    >>> g.ndata['h'] = g.ndata['h'] + 1
    >>> rg.ndata['h']
    tensor([[1.],
            [2.],
            [3.]])
